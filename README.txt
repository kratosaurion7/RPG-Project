1. -----DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT -----
This is a simple project I'm doing to have fun, these are NOT the game files. These files are simply tools to help me figure out how I will proceed with making the game.

2. -----GOALS-----
I want to have at least 30 minutes of content included in the game. How the hell I'm going to dish out that much content, I have no idea. Maybe I should make extra long loading screens  *grin*. 

3. ----- ??? -----
YEah I still habe to come up with this. Requirements maybe ?  "Anything thats got Windows fits"
