1. -----DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT -----
This is a simple project I'm doing to have fun, these are NOT the game files. These files are simply tools to help me figure out how I will proceed with making the game.

2. -----GOALS-----
I want to have at least 30 minutes of content included in the game. How the hell I'm going to dish out that much content, I have no idea. Maybe I should make extra long loading screens  *grin*. 

3. ----- To help debugging -----
You are more than welcome to help me debug part of the game. Download the two binaries (Matrix Tile Practise.exe and its .dll and and the executable. They have to be in the same folder, I have yet to learn how to include the .dll in the .exe if thats even possible.

4. ----- To contribute -----
If you would like to contribute to the projcet, maybe it be modification to the code or comments/suggestions. Send me a mail at tristan.dube@gmail.com and we can talk about it. This was created as a one man project and I'm not really looking for another person to code with me but I would be a fool to refuse help and feedback. Feel free to fork my project and modify it as you want. Just mention my name and we're good to go.
