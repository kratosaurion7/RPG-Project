1. -----DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT -----
This is a simple project I'm doing to have fun, these are NOT the game files. These files are simply tools to help me figure out how I will proceed with making the game.

2. -----GOALS-----
I want to have at least 30 minutes of content included in the game. How the hell I'm going to dish out that much content, I have no idea. Maybe I should make extra long loading screens  *grin*. 

3. ----- ??? -----
YEah I still habe to come up with this. Requirements maybe ?  "Anything thats got Windows fits" 

4. ----- To help debugging -----
You are more than welcome to help me debug part of the game. Just download the binaries and if you find a bug, report it by sending my a text file to my email. 

Only the 2010 executable needs to be debugged. I will *try* to keep the 2008 version updates so everyone can have a go at it. Normaly, both binaries should be of the same version.



How To Report a bug:

1. What is the bug, does Link disappear? Does he moves in the wrong direction ? Transition not working well ?
2. Where did it happen. On which tile did it happen, on a border tile ? Tell me where it happened, don't forget to start counting from 0 with the tiles.
3. The dialog does not function ? Currently only Megaman's are talking, others stays silent. Sadly, I can't do anything if the dialog is boring. This is not a bug.
4. If its a random crash, check if you are the problem. If not, you might want to download my .vb files and try to debug them. If you find information, put it here.

5.Name and return address if I need to contact you.  *Optional*
